With Limonxemo, users can enjoy seamless audio playback experiences, whether they are listening to their favorite tracks or engaging with compelling podcast content. The project aspires to transcend beyond traditional music players by offering support for various audio formats and catering to the diverse needs of creators and listeners alike.

## Features
### Dynamic Background Change

One unique feature of this project is the dynamic background that changes according to the time of day. Using JavaScript's built-in `Date` object, the application fetches the current time from the user's browser and adjusts the background accordingly:

- **Morning:** A background with a sun and clouds.
- **Night:** A background with a moon and clouds.

The logic is as follows:
- If the current time is between 7 PM and 5 AM, the background switches to night mode.
- Otherwise, it remains in day mode.

This feature enhances the user experience by providing a visually pleasing and context-aware interface.

Here's an example of the implementation:

```javascript
// TIME FETCHING
const time = (new Date()).getHours();
if (time >= 19 || time <= 5) document.body.style.backgroundImage = "url('/CodeInstitute-proj02/assets/imgs/bg-night-min.webp')";
else document.body.style.backgroundImage = "url('/CodeInstitute-proj02/assets/imgs/skybg-min.webp')";

```

- **Play/Pause:** Easily play or pause the current track.
- **Skip Forward/Backward:** Move to the next or previous track with a simple click.
- **Seek:** Use the slider to jump to different parts of the track.

### Playlists Management

Users can manage their music library effectively with features like:

- **Add/Remove Tracks:** Easily add or remove tracks from the library.
- **Organize Playlists:** Create, edit, and delete playlists to keep your music organized.

### Responsive Design

The application is designed to work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

The project structure is organized in this way to maintain a clear and coherent organization of all files and resources used in the project development. The 'assets' folder is used to store all project resources, such as audio files, CSS stylesheets, and images. Within the 'audio' folder, subfolders have been created to organize music files and images related to each song. Similarly, the 'css' folder contains CSS files used to style the project interface, while the 'imgs' folder hosts images used in the project. The 'js' folder contains JavaScript files, including the main script 'main.js' and the jQuery script in the 'jq' subfolder. This structure provides an orderly and easy way to access all project resources, facilitating project development and maintenance.


### CSS Management for Project Structure
In this project, we've opted to use only one CSS stylesheet. Since the project is not very large and doesn't require extensive styling, using a single stylesheet helps keep everything centralized and straightforward. This approach simplifies the management of styles and ensures consistency throughout the project

## Wireframes

For the design and layout of the project, wireframes were created to provide a visual representation of the main pages. These wireframes were instrumental in planning the structure and functionality of the application.

### Desktop Wireframe

<details><summary><b>Desktop Wireframe</b></summary>
   <img src="assets/imgs/readme-pics/wf-web.png"></details>
   <hr>

### Mobile / Tablet Wireframe

<details><summary><b>Mobile Wireframe</b></summary>
   <img src="assets/imgs/readme-pics/wf-phone.png"></details>
   <hr>

These wireframes helped in determining the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user experience across different devices.

## Colors
<img src="assets/imgs/readme-pics/buttons-example.png">

In the "Color Customization Process" section, we describe how we drew inspiration from the freshness of summer and the coolness of a lemon. The color palette reflects this, with lemon-yellow and lime-green hues dominating.

Additionally, we carefully selected light blue backgrounds to complement these colors, creating a visually cohesive experience. The transparency of the black sections of the player allows the backgrounds to shine through slightly, adding depth and expanding the visual space. This approach ensures that both the colors and backgrounds work harmoniously to enhance the overall design aesthetics.

<img src="assets/imgs/readme-pics/display-example.png">

## Accessibility
Accessibility has been a priority throughout the development process. The project has been tested using various tools and manual checks to ensure it complies with accessibility standards, providing an inclusive experience for users with diverse needs.

## Wave Validation

The Wave Validation shows 0 errors, 0 contrast errors, and 0 alerts. Previously, there were alerts related to buttons, specifically the lack of a keyboard event handler. These alerts have been resolved by adding appropriate keyboard event handlers for buttons, ensuring better accessibility for devices reliant on keyboard events. With these considerations, we deem the Wave Validation approved, with 0 errors and 0 contrast errors. The project now meets the necessary accessibility standards for both touchscreen and keyboard navigation.

## Lighthouse Validation

Lighthouse Validation has played a pivotal role in shaping the development of our project. This invaluable tool has proven to be highly useful throughout the creation process. While we haven't achieved a high score in the PERFORMANCE category, other aspects have excelled, nearly reaching a perfect score. This outcome provides us with valuable insights into areas for improvement, particularly in optimizing image resolutions. Going forward, we aim to enhance the project by addressing the identified performance-related opportunities.

<img src="assets/imgs/readme-pics/pc-lighthouse.png">

Please note that ongoing development may introduce variations that impact specific validations. We appreciate your understanding as we continue to enhance the Dreams Reader Project.

## JShint Validation

During JShint validation, several variables were identified as unused:

- **Eight unused variables:**
  - Line 64: `now_playing`
  - Line 70: `next_btn`
  - Line 71: `prev_btn`
  - Line 306: `prevTrack`
  - Line 337: `shuffleMix`
  - Line 362: `repeatMix`
  - Line 443: `seekTo`
  - Line 452: `setVolume`

Although JSHint indicates these variables are unused, they are indeed in use within our code. These variables are associated with EventListeners, which might not be recognized correctly by JSHint during the validation process. Consequently, despite JSHint's warnings, these variables are crucial for the application's functionality.

Additionally, JSHint raised some alerts regarding the usage of ES6 features in our JavaScript code. We acknowledge these alerts; however, thanks to modern browsers, ES6 compatibility is generally not an issue. Almost all current browsers support ES6, ensuring our code runs smoothly across different platforms.

Overall, we consider the JSHint validation a success. While it has highlighted certain alerts, they do not pose any issues for our code's performance. The identified variables, though flagged, are integral to the application's operation due to their association with EventListeners.

### Usage Instructions

To make changes to the track list in the `main.js` file and use it effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Open `main.js` file:** Navigate to the directory where your project is located and open the `main.js` file in your preferred code editor.

2. **Locate the `track_list` object:** In the `main.js` file, locate the `track_list` object. This object contains the track information organized by playlist name.

3. **Modify the track list:** To add, remove, or modify tracks in the playlist, edit the `track_list` object accordingly. Each playlist is represented as a key-value pair, where the key is the playlist name and the value is an array of track objects.

4. **Add a new playlist:** To add a new playlist, create a new key-value pair in the `track_list` object. The key should be the name of the playlist, and the value should be an array containing track objects with the necessary information (name, artist, pic, path).

5. **Add new tracks to an existing playlist:** To add new tracks to an existing playlist, locate the array corresponding to that playlist in the `track_list` object and append new track objects to the array.

6. **Remove tracks from a playlist:** To remove tracks from a playlist, locate the array corresponding to that playlist in the `track_list` object and remove the track objects you no longer need.

7. **Save the changes:** Once you have made the necessary modifications to the `track_list` object, save the `main.js` file.

8. **Use the updated track list:** After saving the changes, the updated track list will be used the next time you run your project. Ensure that the file paths for the images and audio tracks are correct and that the files are located in the specified directories.
Unfortunately, I can't directly create or display images or snippets here. However, I can guide you on how to create visual examples using snippets in Markdown:

1. **Create a Before and After Visual Example:** Use two separate code blocks to demonstrate the changes made to the `main.js` file. The first code block will show the original `track_list` object, and the second code block will show the modified `track_list` object.

2. **Add Comments:** Within the code blocks, add comments to indicate the changes made. For example, you can use comments like `// Added new playlist` or `// Removed track C2`.

3. **Use Syntax Highlighting:** Ensure that you use proper syntax highlighting for JavaScript code blocks to improve readability.

Here's an example of how you can structure your file:

```javascript
// Original track list before modifications
const track_list_original = {
    'JMP Studio': [{
            "name": "West Virginia (Diego - Cover)",
            "artist": "JMP",
            "pic": "assets/audio/josus/country-road.png",
            "path": "assets/audio/josus/song1.mp3"
        },
        // Other tracks...
    ],
    // Other playlists...
};
```
```javascript
// Modified track list after adding a new playlist
const track_list = {
    'JMP Studio': [{
            "name": "West Virginia (Diego - Cover)",
            "artist": "JMP",
            "pic": "assets/audio/josus/country-road.png",
            "path": "assets/audio/josus/song1.mp3"
        },
        // Other tracks...
    ],
    'New Playlist': [{
            "name": "New Track",
            "artist": "New Artist",
            "pic": "path/to/new/track.jpg",
            "path": "path/to/new/track.mp3"
        },
        // Other new tracks...
    ],
    // Other playlists...
};
```
By following these steps, you can easily make changes to the track list in your project and use it to showcase your music library effectively.

## Bugs and Challenges
As for bugs, we have encountered a few issues that arise when reloading or initially loading the page. I believe this is related to cache-related issues. One bug we've found is that occasionally, when loading a track within the audio element, it displays a duration of NaN (Not a Number). The problem with this is that depending on the connection speed and cache, it sometimes shows NaN instead of the total duration of the track for a brief period until the track is fully loaded, at which point the program can continue.

Another bug we've encountered is with the audio track slider. Since we have a timer set up in JavaScript to update the slider every minute to show the current progress, the issue arises when attempting to drag the slider node. If you hold down the slider node while dragging, it tries to return to its original position every second due to the ongoing updates. We've identified the code section in JavaScript where this bug occurs, specifically between two commented lines related to event listeners for this element. We've attempted to address this by changing the event listener and trying various solutions, but unfortunately, we haven't found a resolution yet. This is a bug that will need to be addressed in the future.

```javascript
// MAIN.JS at line 164 to 170
//! ####################################
seek_slider.addEventListener('input', () => {
    clearInterval(updateSeekBarPosition);
});

seek_slider.addEventListener('mouseup', () => {
    setInterval(updateSeekBarPosition, 1000);
});
//! ####################################
```
